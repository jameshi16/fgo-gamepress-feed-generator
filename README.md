# Fate Grand/Order GamePress Atom Feed Generator

[![Publish Atom Feed](https://github.com/jameshi16/fgo-gamepress-feed-generator/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jameshi16/fgo-gamepress-feed-generator/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository contains the script to generate an Atom feed from [GamePress's](https://gamepress.gg/c/fategrand-order?page=1) site. I love Atom feeds, and the gem of an Android app known as [Aggregator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tughi.aggregator) (Last updated 2018, but still working well!); however, as far as I can tell, GamePress doesn't generate feeds for Fate/GO.

So, I built my own! [This link](https://fgofeed.codingindex.xyz/atom.xml) directly leads you to the Atom feed, so you can copy it to any Atom feed reader. As the Atom feeds do not contain any content, do set your readers to directly open feed.

# Fate Grand/Order GamePress Atom Feed Generator

[![Publish Atom Feed](https://github.com/jameshi16/fgo-gamepress-feed-generator/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jameshi16/fgo-gamepress-feed-generator/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository contains the script to generate an Atom feed from [GamePress's](https://gamepress.gg/c/fategrand-order?page=1) site. I love Atom feeds, and the gem of an Android app known as [Aggregator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tughi.aggregator) (Last updated 2018, but still working well!); however, as far as I can tell, GamePress doesn't generate feeds for Fate/GO.

So, I made a Python script to generate the feeds, and fed them into GitHub pages! [This link](https://fgofeed.codingindex.xyz/atom.xml) would lead you directly to the Atom feed, so you can copy it to any Atom feed reader. The feeds themselves don't contain any content; you'll need to follow the links specified in the feed ID/link to see your content.
